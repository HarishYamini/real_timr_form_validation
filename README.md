# real_time_form_validation
Real time Form validation ,  using html, css, javaScript.
â€œReal-time form validation is a technique that checks the validity of form inputs as the user types. It allows for immediate feedback on the form and can improve the user experience by catching errors before the form is submitted. This can be achieved by using JavaScript or other scripting languages to listen for changes in the form inputs and immediately validate the data. This can include checking for required fields, validating email addresses and phone numbers, and ensuring that passwords meet certain complexity requirements. Real-time validation also improves data quality and prevents the user from submitting invalid data.
